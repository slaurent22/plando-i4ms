Goal: Collect 4 mask shards without leaving crossroads.

Notes:
- Starting items: Gathering Swarm, Lurien.
- Intended allowed mods are Benchwarp set to "warp only", and QoL (GrubFather should still be slow).
- Infection enables some spicy skips. *Most* of them are blocked off via shade gates.
- The previous note is definitely not like a hint or anything

WARNING: Bench warping while collecting a Mask Shard seems to give you float
at the bench. If this happens you can always save quit to reload.
