Goal: Collect 4 mask shards without leaving crossroads.

Notes:
- Starting items: Gathering Swarm, Lurien.
- Sly's Mask Shard is more expensive.
- Infection enables some spicy skips. Most of them are blocked off; one has a secret treat.
- Intended allowed mods are Benchwarp set to "warp only", and Quality of Life (GrubFather should still be slow).

WARNING: Bench warping while collecting a Mask Shard seems to give you float
at the bench. For speedruns, you may just want to save/quit when the GrubFather Mask Shard splits.
